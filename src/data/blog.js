            "Depression is a common mental health disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. It’s characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest in activities. It is more than just feeling sad or blue; it’s a serious condition that can impact every aspect of a person’s life. Symptoms can vary from mild to severe including: Emotional Symptoms (feeling sad, irritable, empty, hopeless), Physical Symptoms (changes in appetite or sleep patterns, fatigue, or low energy), and Cognitive Symptoms (irrational thoughts, forgetfulness, lack of concentration). It may be caused by a combination of genetics, brain chemistry, trauma, and stress. Depression is a treatable condition, and help is a sign of strength, not weakness. It can be managed with the help of psychotherapies, medication, lifestyle changes, and support groups.",

Individuals with autism may experience challenges in various areas, including social communication, interaction, and restricted or repetitive behaviors. The causes of ASD may include genetic factors, environmental influences, and differences in brain development. Diagnosis typically involves evaluating an individual’s behavior and developmental history. ASD is a complex and multifaceted condition. While there is no cure, it can be managed effectively through behavioral therapies, educational interventions, and strong family support. Autism is a spectrum, and individuals with autism bring unique perspectives and strengths.
